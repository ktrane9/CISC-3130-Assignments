In Assignment 2 I was directed to process the top songs from previous weeks on Spotify.
Using the data I sorted the songs alphabetically and then put them into a Queue that would act as a playlist.
From there I pushed every song from the Queue and into the Stack so that it could trace the most recent
song played.

The most recent song is printed to the output file.
