Assignment 1 Document - Kohl Elie
---------------------------------

In order for the navigator to see my code correctly, 
I have organized my files in such a way that the documented files
like this one are on the outside of the source folder.
The source folder is where I keep the code for Assignment 1.java,
Artsits.java, and Top_Artists.java. In the data folder I will keep
the data that will be used in the code after it is read in.
